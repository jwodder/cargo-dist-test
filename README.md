This is a test of my somewhat-customized
[`cargo-dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist) setup.

Installation
============

`cargo-dist-test` is neither a library nor on crates.io, but if it were, you
could use the `cargo-dist-test` library in your Cargo project by adding the
following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cargo-dist-test = "0.1.0"
```
